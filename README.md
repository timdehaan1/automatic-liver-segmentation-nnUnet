These are the files I've used to train and test nnUnet models. This directory doesn't contain all files however, because they were too big to upload. If you want to access those files, read the instructions below.

In the luna environment, go to /home/rnga/tsdehaan/my-scratch/. "Data_nnUNet/" contains the raw and preprocessed data, and also the resulting trained nnUnet model. "data van de 1e keer/" contains the data used in
the first dataset. "results/" contains the test results, the ensembled model based on those results and a summary of the evaluation of the model. 

Furthermore, I've changed the original nnUnet code somewhat, because I've run into a couple of errors. The final code used can be found in /home/rnga/tsdehaan/.conda/envs/mijn_env/
